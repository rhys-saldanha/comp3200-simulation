# Framework for Simulating Antibiotic Resistance Fitness Landscapes

This project was developed as part of my 3rd Year BSc Computer Science Project. The aim was to simulate a finite bacterial population with birth, death and evolution events. An investigation was then carried out into the repeatability of histories and the rise of dominant paths in different landscapes, where the fitness of two child genotypes to the wildtype differ slightly.

The accompanying project report can be found here.
